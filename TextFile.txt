Start spreading the news  
I am leaving today
I want to be a part of it, New York, New York
These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
And make a brand new start of it
New York, New York
I want to wake up in the city that doesn't sleeps
To find I am king of the hill, top of the heap
These little town blues
Are melting away
I will make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there
I will make it anywhere
Itis up to you, New York, New York
New York, New York
I want to wake up, in the city that doesn't sleeps
To find I am king of the hill, top of the heap
Cr√®me of the crop and the top of the heap
My little town blues
Are melting away
I will make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there
I will make it anywhere
Come on, Come though, New York, New York
